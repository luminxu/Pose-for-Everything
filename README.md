### Abstract
Existing works on 2D pose estimation mainly focus on a certain category, e.g. human, animal, and vehicle. However, there are lots of application scenarios that require detecting the poses/keypoints of the unseen class of objects. In this paper, we introduce the task of CategoryAgnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE), which aims to create a pose estimation model capable of detecting the pose of any class of object given only a few samples with keypoint definition. To achieve this goal, we formulate the pose estimation problem as a keypoint matching problem and design a novel CAPE framework, termed POse Matching Network (POMNet). A transformer-based Keypoint Interaction Module (KIM) is proposed to capture both the interactions among different keypoints and the relationship between the support and query images. We also introduce Multi-category Pose (MP-100) dataset, which is a 2D pose dataset of 100 object categories containing over 20K instances and is well-designed for developing CAPE algorithms. Experiments show that our method outperforms other baseline approaches by a large margin. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/luminxu/Pose-for-Everything.

## Usage

### Install

1. Install [mmpose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose).
2. run `python setup.py develop`.

### Training
You can follow the guideline of [mmpose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/blob/master/docs/en/get_started.md).

#### Train with multiple GPUs
```shell
./tools/dist_train.sh ${CONFIG_FILE} ${GPU_NUM} [optional arguments]
```

#### Train with multiple machines

If you can run this code on a cluster managed with [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/), you can use the script `slurm_train.sh`. (This script also supports single machine training.)

```shell
./tools/slurm_train.sh ${PARTITION} ${JOB_NAME} ${CONFIG_FILE} ${WORK_DIR}
```

Here is an example of using 16 GPUs to train POMNet on the dev partition in a slurm cluster.
(Use `GPUS_PER_NODE=8` to specify a single slurm cluster node with 8 GPUs, `CPUS_PER_TASK=2` to use 2 cpus per task.
Assume that `Test` is a valid ${PARTITION} name.)

```shell
GPUS=16 GPUS_PER_NODE=8 CPUS_PER_TASK=2 ./tools/slurm_train.sh Test pomnet \
  configs/mp100/pomnet/pomnet_mp100_split1_256x256_1shot.py \
  work_dirs/pomnet_mp100_split1_256x256_1shot
```
